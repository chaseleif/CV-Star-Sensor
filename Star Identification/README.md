**cascade_test19** - The latest iteration of the test program. This will apply a full set of cascades (following the naming convention) to a particular input image (which has had fiducial markers applied) and then attempt to perform a detection process. The code is fully annotated, and more detail is found within the MSc Thesis paper for this project.
