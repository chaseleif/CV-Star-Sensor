## The programs in this folder are used to test cascades against a supplied star image 

**cascade_test2** - will identify as many target objects as can be found using the cv2 detectMultiScale function.

**cascade_test3** - will also identify the same targets, but will only select and display that with the largest bounding box.

**cascade_test5** - now also records and displays the levelWeight value.

**cascade_test6** - as 5, but for running two cascades simultaneously.

**cascade_test7** - designed to display only the result with the highest levelWeight value.

**cascade_test8** - as 7, but for running two cascades simultaneously.
