# CV-Star-Sensor
MSc Project repo for computer vision star identification and satellite orientation project.

This repository shall be used to store all versions of the code generated as part of this project.

Contents so far:
- Python program using OpenCV to identify the pixel locations of the brightest stars in a given image.
- Sample images generated using Stellarium for testing purposes.
- Python programs to capture raw Bayer format images using the Pi V2 camera, and to demosaic said images.
- Simple project wiki.

Expected contents shall be:
- Python code using OpenCV library for star identification.
- Image degradation code for simulation of star field images taken on-orbit using CMOS camera.
- Likely other code for generation of image databases and testing.
- Data of star databases used for this project.
- Detailed project wiki.
