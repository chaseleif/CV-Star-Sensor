# CV-Star-Sensor

## MSc Project repo for computer vision star identification and satellite orientation project (CURRENTLY ACTIVE)

Please see a short explanatory video on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYilzSxmrGo).

**Contents so far:**
- Stellarium scripts used to capture thousands of images from Stellarium in order to be processed into negative image datasets for machine learning training.
- Zipped folders containing negative image datasets, as well as bg.txt files, and python programs used to create these.
- Python programs used to create the positive images used for cascade training. 
- Image files of the fiducial markers applied to starfields, to identify the patterns of bright stars that the machine learning relies upon for the identification.
- Python programs used to test the trained cascades against a supplied starfield image.

**For the future:**

As of 16/08/19, I have finished working on this project as part of my University course. I hope to be able to spend further time on it as a hobby in order to keep developing the system, there are lots of improvements and additions I would like to have time to make. I hope that this repository may be of use to someone, and if you have questions please contact me. The best source of reference here is my MSc Thesis itself, which can be found above.
