# CV-Star-Sensor
MSc Project repo for computer vision star identification and satellite orientation project.

This repository shall be used to store all versions of the code generated as part of this project.

Expected contents shall be:
- Python code using OpenCV library for star identification.
- Image degradation code for simulation of star field images taken on-orbit using CMOS camera.
- Likely other code for generation of image databases and testing.
