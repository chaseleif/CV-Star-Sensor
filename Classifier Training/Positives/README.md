These python programs are used to generate the 50x50 positives image used for the cascade training process. The method by which this happens is firstly the bright stars in an input image are identified, then a marker with a transparent background is placed onto each pixel coordinate where the bright stars are located. 

test_creation3 was the program used to generate the samples used for the fiducial marker testing. 

test_creation5 is an updated version (designed to work with fiducial 6) that mergers the markers together.
